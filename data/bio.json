	"content" : ": the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination. That is how <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/\">dictionary.com</a> defines creativity, I love everything about that. Something about taking emptiness and filling it with something meaningful, a spark that may be ephemeral or eternal but if you create for even a second. You change the world as you know it. I am Duane K. Anderson founder and owner of DKAnderson Designs LLC a nerd, adventurer, poet, painter, lover of life and true believer in the immutable power of the human spirit.
